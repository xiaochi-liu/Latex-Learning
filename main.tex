Let $a$ and $b$ be distinct positive integers, and let $c = a - b + 1$ 

$y = c_2x^2 + c_1x + c_0$

$F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$

$\mu = Ae^{Q/RT}$

$\Omega = \sum_{k-1}^n\omega_k$

The roots of a quadratic equation are given by
\begin{equation}
    x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\end{equation}
where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are \ldots

We can write $\Omega = \sum_{k-1}^{n} \omega_k$ in text, or we can write
\begin{equation}
    \Omega = \sum_{k-1}^{n} \omega_k
\end{equation}
to display it.
